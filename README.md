# Python List Operations

This repository contains a simple Python script (my_list_operations.py) that demonstrates fundamental list operations in Python. The script follows a series of steps to create, modify, and analyze a list.

Operations Performed
The script performs the following operations on a list:

Creation: Initializes an empty list.

Append: Adds the integers 10, 20, 30, 40 to the end of the list.

Insert: Inserts the integer 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extend: Appends the elements of another list, [50, 60, 70], to the end.

Remove: Deletes the last element from the list.

Sort: Sorts the list in ascending order.

Find Index: Locates and prints the index of the value 30.

How to Run the Code
To run this script, you will need a Python environment set up on your machine.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name



Run the Python file:

python my_list_operations.py


Expected Output
After running the script, the console output will show the state of the list after each operation. The final line will display the index of the number 30.
